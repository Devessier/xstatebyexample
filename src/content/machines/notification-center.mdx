Many applications use toasts to give feedback to the user about an action.
I've often used [React-Toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)
to notify the user that she could be signed in successfully or that the website performed an automatic update in the background.

React-Toastify has many interesting features:

- You render the `<ToastContainer />` component at the top level of your application, and later, you can call the `toast()` function wherever and expect a toast to appear.
- Toasts can have a timer or be displayed for an indeterminate time.
- When the user unfocuses the page, all toasts running a timer are frozen, and the timers restart when the user focuses the page again.
- There can be multiple toasts, and notifications are stacked from the most recent to the oldest.
- The configuration of each toast is independent. One toast can have a timeout when another doesn't.

## Example

<DemoEntrypoint client:load />

## Code

<Tabs labels={['Machine', 'React', 'Visualizer']} client:load>
  <Fragment slot="1">
    <DemoMachineCode />
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="2">
    <DemoReactCode />
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="3">
    <StatelyVisualizer src="https://stately.ai/registry/editor/embed/ffb84170-4403-4304-889d-3eefadc0465b?machineId=0b1e0d81-ec76-4ebf-bfb1-fd952e9ac8ef" />
  </Fragment>
</Tabs>

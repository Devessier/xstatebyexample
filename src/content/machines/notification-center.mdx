Many applications use toasts to give feedback to the user about an action.
I've often used [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/)
to notify the user that she could be signed in successfully or that the website performed an automatic update in the background.

React Toastify has many exciting features:

- You render the `<ToastContainer />` component at the top level of your application, and later, you can call the `toast()` function wherever and expect a toast to appear.
- Toasts can have a timer or be displayed for an indeterminate time.
- When the user unfocuses the page, all toasts running a timer are frozen, and the timers restart when the user focuses the page again.
- There can be multiple toasts, and notifications are stacked from the most recent to the oldest.
- The configuration of each toast is independent. One toast can have a timeout when another doesn't.

This example is a simplified re-implementation of React Toastify with XState.

## Example

To play with the demo, **hover over the notifications, focus another window and switch to another tab**.

<DemoEntrypoint client:load />

This example is based on [the Notification machine](/notification).
Two state machines and one callback logic are involved.

The root machine is `notificationCenterMachine`. This state machine doesn't define any _child state_;
there is only the [_root state_](https://stately.ai/docs/parent-states#root-state).

### Spawning notification actors

The `notificationCenterMachine` acts as a proxy, knowing what notification actors are available and forwarding events to them.
Its context contains a `notificationRefs` array.

When the state machine receives the `notification.trigger` event, it executes the `Assign notification configuration into context` action,
which [_spawns_](https://stately.ai/docs/spawn) a new notification actor and prepends the reference to the `notificationRefs` array. The `notificationMachine` is spawned
with its [_input_](https://stately.ai/docs/input), containing the timeout, title, and description properties,
defining how the notification machine will behave.

The `notificationMachine` sets its initial context as the input received. In this specific case, the types of the context and the input are equal, and we can do as follows:

```ts
context: ({ input }) => input,
```

### Controlling the CSS animation

The notifications with a timeout display a progress bar, which is stopped when the user hovers over the notification or unfocuses the page.

<div
  class={css({
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    "& img": { maxWidth: "500px", w: "full" },
  })}
>
  ![A user hovers over the notification and it automatically
  stops](../../assets/notification-center/animation-stops-on-hover.gif)
</div>

Inspired by React Toastify, the timer of the notification is managed by the browser: the end of the animation is waited for with the [`animationend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationend_event) event,
and the animation is paused with the [`animation-play-state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state) CSS property.

When the animation of the progress bar ends, the React component sends an `animation.end` event to the notification's actor. The state machine then goes to the `Done` state
and sends a `notification.closed` event to its parent, [as discussed below](#cleaning-stopped-actors).

```tsx
onAnimationEnd={() => {
  notificationRef.send({
    type: "animation.end",
  });
}}
```

The animation runs when the `notificationMachine` is in `Waiting for timeout.Active` state:

```tsx
style={{
  animationDuration: state.context.timeout! + "ms",
  animationPlayState:
    state.matches({ "Waiting for timeout": "Active" }) === true
      ? "running"
      : "paused",
}}
```

Relying on the animation's state is brilliant because the browser serves as the single source of truth.
One fun side effect of doing so is that if you pause the animation in the dev tools ([Firefox can do that](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/work_with_animations/index.html#animation-playback)),
the notification won't close unexpectedly.

Instinctively, I would have opted for a full-JS implementation, probably using `setTimeout` and `Date.now()`,
to control the position where the animation should restart after a pause. CSS deserves much more love!

### Listening to window focus and blur

We need to call `window.addEventListener()` to know when the page is focused or blurred.
I don't want to listen to these events in each notification actor; these events are not tied to any specific notification.
It would be better to have a single listener for each of them.

It's perfect because we already have a state machine singleton wrapping every notification!
The `notificationCenterMachine` invokes the `windowFocusLogic` actor, which sets up the listeners for the `focus` and `blur` events.

```ts
const windowFocusLogic = fromCallback(({ sendBack }) => {
  window.addEventListener("focus", () => {
    sendBack({
      type: "window.focus",
    });
  });

  window.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    sendBack({
      type: "window.blur",
    });
  });
});

const notificationCenterMachine = createMachine({
  invoke: {
    src: windowFocusLogic,
  },
});
```

When `windowFocusLogic` calls the `sendBack` function with an event, the `notificationCenterMachine`
receives it as if a React component sent it from outside the machine.
It then forwards the event to every notification actor:

```ts
const notificationCenterMachine = createMachine({
  invoke: {
    src: windowFocusLogic,
  },
  "window.*": {
    actions: enqueueActions(({ enqueue, context, event }) => {
      for (const ref of context.notificationRefs) {
        enqueue.sendTo(ref, event);
      }
    }),
  },
});
```

The [`enqueueActions`](https://stately.ai/docs/actions#enqueue-actions) action programmatically defines which actions XState should run.
Usually, it's better to rely on the basic actions that make it easier to introspect the machine to determine what it does.
But, sometimes, running a JavaScript function is necessary to determine what actions XState must execute.

Note that `enqueueActions` _enqueues_ actions; it doesn't execute them right away. Actions are always declarative and pure with XState.
It's crucial for APIs like [`state.can()`](https://stately.ai/docs/states#statecaneventtype) to work.

We must use `enqueueActions` because we don't know the number of notification actors in advance; we must compute some JavaScript to determine it.

### Cleaning stopped actors

When the notification is closed because the user clicked the close button or reached the timeout,
the `notificationMachine` goes to the `Done` state. In this state, the machine sends a `notification.closed` event to its parent:

```ts
Done: {
  entry: sendParent(({ context }) => ({
    type: "notification.closed",
    notificationId: context.notificationId,
  })),
}
```

To stop a spawned actor stored in the context of a machine, you need to do two things:

- Stop the actor with the [`stopChild`](https://stately.ai/docs/actions#stop-child-action) action.
- Remove the reference to the actor from the context with the `assign` action.

When the `notificationCenterMachine` receives a `notification.closed` event, it executes two actions:

1. `Stop closed notification`
2. `Remove closed notification from context`

Each notification actor gets an ID when spawned; this is how the `notificationCenterMachine` knows which actor to stop.

## Integrate the Notification Center with an Actor System

A Notification Center is typically a unique actor. There is a single Notification Center in an application,
and every time you want to trigger a notification, you need to reach out to it.

I usually create an `appMachine` managing the authentication state and make it globally available throughout the code base.
We can invoke the `notificationCenterMachine` at the root state of the `appMachine` to make it live in every state.

With the [Systems](https://stately.ai/docs/system) feature of XState 5, we can even make the Notification Center
available to the whole hierarchy of actors invoked and spawned by or under the `appMachine`:

```ts
const childMachine = createMachine({
  entry: sendTo(({ system }) => system.get("notification-center"), {
    type: "notification.trigger",
    title: "Child machine has been loaded",
    description: "Start sending it some events",
    timeout,
  }),
});

const appMachine = createMachine({
  invoke: {
    src: notificationCenterMachine,
    systemId: "notification-center",
  },
  initial: "Checking if user is initially authenticated",
  states: {
    "Checking if user is initially authenticated": {
      /** */
    },
    Authenticated: {
      invoke: {
        src: childMachine,
      },
    },
    "Not authenticated": {
      /** */
    },
  },
});
```

This example doesn't implement that, but this pattern may suit real-world applications well.

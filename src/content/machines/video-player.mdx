Video players are commonly used across the web. The options are to use a library (like [ReactPlayer](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player)), the player of video hosting platforms (YouTube embedded player), or the native HTML [`<video />`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tag.

Whatever solution you choose, a video player requires complex logic to handle:

- Video chunks not coming in time
- Mouse, keyboard, and touch controls, as well as the device's native controls you don't control
- Differences in UX interactions between device types

As for any complex logic, state machines shine, making the implementation more robust.

The UI and the UX of this example are based on the video players of [france.tv](https://www.france.tv/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). The UI inspiration mainly comes from france.tv.

Here are a few ideas of things you can test:

- [Throttle your network in your browser's devtools.](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-perform-network-throttling-in-chrome)
- Test on a desktop, tablet, and mobile device. The UX should be different based on whether your device supports hovering elements.
- You can use the keyboard to interact with the video when it has the focus
  - `f` for fullscreen
  - `Space` and `k` for playing state
  - `Left arrow` and `Right arrow` to go Â±10s
- Controls are shown when hovering over the video with a mouse on a desktop and clicking on the video on a mobile device.
- If the video is playing, controls are shown on mouse hover. They are never hidden when the video is paused unless you are on a mobile device. You can hide controls on a mobile device whenever you want.

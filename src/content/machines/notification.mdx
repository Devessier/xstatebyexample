Notifications, toasts, and snackbars – however you name them – are essential UI elements suitable to be implemented with a state machine.
They use a timer, and this single reason is enough to use XState for me.

This notification example allows only a single notification to be opened simultaneously.
Stacking notifications will be showcased on another machine and involve spawned actors.

## Example

A notification can be triggered only in the `Closed` state, that is, when the notification is not opened yet.
Conversely, it can only be closed in the `Open` state.

When entering the `Open` state, it will first go to the `Checking if timer is required` state.
This state, often called a *determining state*, checks if a timeout has been defined for the notification.
If a timeout was defined, it goes to `Waiting for timeout`. Otherwise, it goes to `Waiting for manual action`.
The machine uses an *eventless transition* with the `always` keyword. This state is exited immediately after entering.

The `close` event is listened to in both `Waiting for timeout` and `Waiting for manual action` states.
When the `close` event is received, the machine goes to the `Done` state, whose type is `final`.
The `Open` state defines an `onDone` transition, taken when it reaches one of its child final states,
and makes the machine go back to `Closed` state.

The benefit of the `Done` state is explicitly saying that it's the end of the `Closed` state.
It also acts as a layer of abstraction: the child states of `Open` don't have to know about states outside their parent.

Final states are a powerful feature of state charts, especially [with parallel states](https://stately.ai/docs/parallel-states#parallel-ondone-transition).

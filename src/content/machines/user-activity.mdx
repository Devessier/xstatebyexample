[VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) is a gold mine for Vue.js developers. It's a collection of *composables* (aka hooks in the Vue world).

VueUse brings complex utility functions, like the [`useIdle`](https://vueuse.org/core/useIdle/) composable that tracks the user's activity on the page. The composable listens to every `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `resize`, `keydown`, `touchart`, and `wheel` event and considers the user active for a specific duration after receiving one of these events.
The `useIdle` composable restarts the timer whenever the user interacts with the page.

/>

XState excels at orchestrating code with timers, and this example will be fun to reimplement! It combines the [debouncing](/debouncing/) and [throttling](/throttling/) patterns.

## Example

You can interact with the page and see the timer remain at 0s, or stop interacting with the page in any way,
and see it increase and the state `Idle` value becoming `true`:

<DemoEntrypoint client:load />

### Listening to DOM events

The `domEventListener` logic is a callback that sets up many event listeners on the window and optionally on the document.
A callback logic can return a callback function that's called when an actor that was invoked or spawned based on the logic stops.

Every time the `window` or the `document` receives one of the listened events, the logic sends an `"activity"` event to its parent actor.

```ts
const domEventListener = fromCallback(({ input, sendBack }) => {
  /**
   * Set up event listeners.
   */
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", () => {
    sendBack({
      type: "activity"
    });
  });

  document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
    sendBack({
      type: "activity"
    });
  });

  return () => {
    /**
     * Clear event listeners.
     */
  };
});
```

The `domEventListener` logic is invoked at the root state of the machine and renamed to `Listen to DOM events`:

```ts
export const userActivityMachine = setup({
  // ...
  actors: {
    "Listen to DOM events": domEventListener,
  },
  // ...
}).createMachine({
  // ...
  invoke: {
    src: "Listen to DOM events",
    input: ({ context }) => ({
      events: context.events,
      listenForVisibilityChange: context.listenForVisibilityChange,
    }),
  },
  // ...
});
```

As we'll see below, the state machine handles the `"activity"` events differently based on its current state.

### Use timers to detect the user's inactivity

The user is, by default, considered active. The initial state is `Active.Idle`,
and a timer is instantly started with the value of the dynamic delay `"Inactivity timeout"`.

When the timer ends, it targets the `Active.Done` *final* state, which triggers a transition to the `Inactive` state.

```ts
createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: "Active",
  states: {
    Active: {
      initial: "Idle",
      states: {
        Idle: {
          after: {
            "Inactivity timeout": {
              target: "Done",
            },
          },
        },
        Deduplicating: { /** */ },
        Done: {
          type: "final",
        },
      },
      onDone: {
        target: "Inactive",
      },
    },
    Inactive: { /** */ },
  },
});
```

I like to rely on final states to emphasize where a flow ends.
I dislike using global state IDs as targets and prefer using final states.

When the state machine receives the `"activity"` event in the `Active.Idle` state, it targets the `Active.Deduplicating` state:

```ts {14-19}
createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: "Active",
  states: {
    Active: {
      initial: "Idle",
      states: {
        Idle: {
          after: {
            "Inactivity timeout": {
              target: "Done",
            },
          },
          on: {
            activity: {
              target: "Deduplicating",
              actions: "Assign last active timestamp to context",
            },
          },
        },
        Deduplicating: { /** */ },
        Done: {
          type: "final",
        },
      },
      onDone: {
        target: "Inactive",
      },
    },
    Inactive: { /** */ },
  },
});
```

The `Active.Deduplicating` state [*throttles*](/throttling/) the `"activity"` event.
Following the throttling pattern, the state machine stops listening to the event for some time.
It starts a timer of 50ms and then transitions back to the `Active.Idle` state.

```ts {22-26}
createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: "Active",
  states: {
    Active: {
      initial: "Idle",
      states: {
        Idle: {
          after: {
            "Inactivity timeout": {
              target: "Done",
            },
          },
          on: {
            activity: {
              target: "Deduplicating",
              actions: "Assign last active timestamp to context",
            },
          },
        },
        Deduplicating: {
          after: {
            50: {
              target: "Idle",
            },
          },
        },
        Done: {
          type: "final",
        },
      },
      onDone: {
        target: "Inactive",
      },
    },
    Inactive: { /** */ },
  },
});
```

[The `useIdle` composable throttles events by 50ms](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/blob/cea5078cd148b68a04b7c2b342eec31f6f017619/packages/core/useIdle/index.ts#L69-L75).
I assume the reason is that it's cheaper to create a 50ms timer than creating many more timers that would be created if it wasn't throttling and the state machine was receiving a lot of `"activity"` events.

Finally, the `Inactive` state also listens to the `"activity"` event and transitions to the `Active` state:

```ts {13-18}
createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: "Active",
  states: {
    Active: {
      initial: "Idle",
      states: { /** */ },
      onDone: {
        target: "Inactive",
      },
    },
    Inactive: {
      on: {
        activity: {
          target: "Active",
          actions: "Assign last active timestamp to context",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The code for this example is short, but the logic represented is not simple.
XState makes managing timers so easy that it hides the underlying complexity
and instead makes the intrinsic logic stand out.

One of my favorite uses of XState is for global state management.
It excels in an environment fully controlled by JavaScript, like a SPA (Single Page Application) or React Native.

There is no concept of links in React Native. When using React Navigation, you must
[declare the routes available based on the authentication state](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow#how-it-will-work).
It will automatically redirect the user to the first authenticated/not-authenticated route:

```tsx
function Navigation() {
  if (isCheckingInitialAuth === true) {
    return <SplashScreen />
  }

  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      {isSignedIn === true ? (
        <>
          <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
        </>
      )}
    </Stack.Navigator>
  )
}
```

This state machine is better suitable for this use case where you must control everything happening,
including the HTTP requests made to your authentication API.

## Example

The state machine first checks if the user is initially authenticated.
In a real-world application, you would request a `/me` endpoint or authentication third-party service here.
The machine redirects the user to the screen matching her authentication state.
The machine stores the user's data in the context of the machine after having retrieved them from the external API.

If the user is not initially authenticated, the machine redirects her to the sign-in screen,
where she can go to the sign-up screen.

When the user submits the sign-in or the sign-up form, the machine requests the auth API and expects it
to return whether the operation succeeded and, optionally, an error code or the user's data. These data are stored
in the context of the machine to be used in the UI part.

An authenticated user can sign out from the website. The machine will make another request to the auth API to invalidate
the authentication token, and it will clear the user's data. The machine will also redirect the user back to the sign-in screen.

Error handling is crucial in this scenario. In case of an error during signing-in or signing-up, an alert is displayed
with the error in a human-readable format. Promise actors can throw errors; the machine handles them thanks to the `onError` transitions.

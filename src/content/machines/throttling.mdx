import DemoEntrypoint from "../../examples/throttling/index.tsx";

The throttling pattern looks like the [debouncing](/debouncing/) one,
but instead of restarting a timer when the machine receives an event,
it stops listening to events temporarily.

In the following example, when the machine receives the first `click` event,
it goes into the `Throttling` state. The `click` event is not listened by the machine in this state.
The `Throttling` state starts a timer of one second, which targets the `Idle` state.

## Example

Try incrementing the counter by clicking the `Increment` button below.
The counter will be incremented once every second.

The state machine is resilient to spamming. It controls how it should behave if the user abuses the button.

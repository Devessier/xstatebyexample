import Tabs from '../components/Tabs.tsx';
import DemoEntrypoint from '../components/debouncing/index.tsx';

The debouncing pattern is crucial to UI development.
Debouncing – and [throttling](/throttling) – are used to moderate
how much a function is called on a time basis.

When we *debounce* a function by 200ms, the function will be called only 200ms
after the function has been called for the last time.
If the function is called again before the timer ends,
the timer is aborted, and another one is started; the function is not called.

## Example

Try incrementing the counter by clicking the `Increment` button below.
The counter will be incremented one second after you stop clicking the button.

The state machine is resilient to spamming. It controls how it should behave if the user abuses the button.

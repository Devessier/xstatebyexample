The debouncing pattern is crucial to UI development.
Debouncing – and [throttling](/throttling) – is used to moderate
how much a function is called by a time basis.

When we *debounce* a function by 200ms, the function will actually be called only 200ms
after the function has been called for the last time.
If the function is called again before the timer ends,
the timer is aborted and another one is started; the function is not called.

Let's make it visual:

<ButtonDemo client:idle />

The throttling pattern looks like the [debouncing](/debouncing) one, but instead of restarting a timer when the machine receives an event, it stops listening to events temporarily.

In the following example, when the machine receives the first `click` event it goes in `Throttling` state. The `click` event is not listened by the machine in this state. The `Throttling` state starts a timer of one second which targets the `Idle` state back.

## Example

Try to increment the counter by clicking on the `Increment` button bellow.
The counter will be incremented at most most once every second.

The state machine is resilient to spamming. It controls how it should behave if the user abuses the button.
